            <p>Therefore let your light so shine before this people, that they may see your good works and glorify your
                Father who is in heaven.</p>

            <h2>Mosiah 2:41</h2>
            <p>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep
                the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if
                they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in
                a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God
                hath spoken it.
