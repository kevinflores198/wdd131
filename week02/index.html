                    <p>Hi I am Kevin Flores, I am 26 years old, I am married with a beautifoul wife
                        called Lourdes, we have been together for a long time, like 10 years, however
                        we have 2 years married. We are argentinian people but we are living in
                        Florianopolis Brasil due to have economic problems in our country, we would
                        like to come back but we cannot for the moment. We work from home, home office,
                        in an USA company that gives service for people located there, and I thought as
                        I know english I could study in BUY Idaho online to get better my aknowlage of
                        programming web Full Stack that I was learning before to start. I hope I can learn
                        a lot being here for those 3 years. I know a lot of Java, Java Script and HTML CSS,
                        but I wanted to get a review and improuve what I do not know.</p>
